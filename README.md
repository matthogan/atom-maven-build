# maven-build package

Runs Maven from Atom because if I want to use this editor for work and get
away from the memory sucking eclipse bloat then this would be a handy tool.

I'm sure someone can do a better job but I haven't found such a tool yet.

Warning: Code will be rudimentary and laughable for Node.js experts... My
JavaScript know-how is strictly 1990s. I haven't learned the conventions yet
and I don't understand the packaging API well enough.
